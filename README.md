This code processes and analyzes performance statistics for 8 athletes participating in the Olympic Games. It allows the user to input and validate pre-final and final race times for each athlete, ensuring values fall within acceptable ranges (9.50–10.50 seconds). It then calculates:

  The best and worst pre-final times.
  The number of athletes who achieved a final time under 9.80 seconds.
  Additional performance metrics such as the athlete with the greatest improvement.

Ideal for generating summary statistics of athlete performances.

## Features

- Accepts and validates user input for pre-final and final race times within the range of 9.50–10.50 seconds.
- Calculates the best (minimum) and worst (maximum) pre-final times.
- Counts how many athletes achieved a final time under 9.80 seconds.
- Identifies the athlete with the greatest improvement in their timing.

## Usage

1. **Input:**  
   - The user enters the best pre-final time and final time for each athlete (8 in total).  
   - The program ensures input values are within the acceptable range (9.50–10.50 seconds).  
   - Invalid inputs prompt the user to re-enter values.

2. **Processing:**  
   - The program processes the data to compute:
     - The best and worst pre-final times.
     - The number of athletes who achieved a time below 9.80 seconds in the finals.
     - The athlete with the greatest improvement from pre-final to final time.

3. **Output:**  
   - Displays a summary of results, including the calculated metrics.
  
-- Prerequisites
